                    Any weight loss estimates are calculated using the gold-standard Harris-Benedict equation. This does not at all guarantee that you will achieve these results. Results vary for a multitude of reasons. Whether genetic or environmental, it should be noted that food intake, rates of metabolism and levels of exercise and physical exertion vary from person to person. This means weight loss results will also vary from person to person. All quoted results and testimonials do not imply that you will achieve these results. You are responsible for safely monitoring and managing your weight change. If you ever have a medical concern about your weight change, you should speak to a health-care professional. You should also speak to a health-care professional before starting a new weight loss plan.
